      <div className='about-div text-white  py-5 px-4 mt-4 mb-10 border-2 border-white'>
        <p className='py-3'><b>Basically</b>, I am from Pano Akil, which is located in district Sukkur, Sindh, Pakistan.
        I am enrolled in <b>Governor Sindh Initiative for Web3, Metaverse, and GenAI.</b> Recently, we have completed our first quarter, in which we learned about <b>Typescript, JavaScript, HTML and CSS.</b> And now 2nd quarter is started, in which we are going to explore about <b>React</b> and <b>Nextjs</b>. I am passionate about learning all the things at my best level, and I will apply all my concepts to build interactive web and mobile applications.</p>
        <p className='py-3'><b>My dream</b> is to build an application like, Facebook because I recently discovered that all popular applications such as WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, Instagram, and many other social media apps are created by foreigners. As a Pakistan, I want to build such an application that can also be very beneficial 
        for my country economically. It can bring about new jobs and increase IT export in Pakistan. As an individual I want to play my role for betterment of my beloved country Pakistan as much as I can. </p>
        <p className='py-3'><b>Further,</b> I would tell about myself that before enrolling in the Governor's IT program, I had no computer side background and was doing an Electronic Enginnering degree that is recently completed.
        The aim to tell you all the things that everyone should play a positive role for the society you are living in no matter how difficult the circumstances are, keep working and believe in yourself and believe in Allah.</p>
